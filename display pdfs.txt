Summary

Create a repo named USERNAME.github.io.
In that repo, click Settings then click Automatic Page Generator, then complete the wizard to publish a User Page.
Go back to your content repo and click Settings then click Automatic Page Generator, then complete the wizard to publish a Project Page. (Logically, the project page's files would go in a special directory but GitHub puts them in a gh-pages branch. Don't merge that branch to/from master.)
Sync the gh-pages branch to your computer then copy in your PDFs:

git checkout gh-pages
git checkout master -- 'docs/*.pdf'

Commit the changes and push them to GitHub.
Now go back to the repo on GitHub and use the Automatic Page Generator to edit the Project Page, adding links to these PDFs of the form:

[Intro.pdf](http://USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME/docs/Intro.pdf).

Republish the Project Page.
